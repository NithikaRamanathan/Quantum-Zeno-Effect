# Quantum-Zeno-Effect

## Introduction
The Zeno paradox was created by the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea, who said that if you shoot an arrow at the target, then at any given moment in time, the arrow is motionless, and therefore the arrow should not be able to move at all. This principle was eventually applied to quantum mechanics in what has been called the Quantum Zeno Effect. This effect says that when you continuously observe a quantum system, you can stop it from evolving and “freeze” it in its original state.

This is because in quantum mechanics, measuring a quantum system destroys the superposition of the system, which means it forces the system to collapse into one state (0 or 1), instead of allowing it to remain a combination of both states. If you repeatedly force a quantum system to collapse into one particular state, you can reduce the probability that it will evolve into a different state. This probability decreases as the period of time between the measurements decreases.
